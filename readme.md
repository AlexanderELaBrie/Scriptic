# Welcome

This is the official repository for the entirety of the Scriptic site.  Consider it a backup in case everything explodes.

## Development Environment Setup

You'll need to install Node Package Manager (NPM) and run the `npm install` command from the `wp-content\themes\scriptic` directory.  This should get you all the necessary packages.  Check out gulpfile.js if you'd like to see the specifics, but you can simply use the command line interface, navigate to the `wp-content\themes\scriptic` directory, and run `gulp` if looking to edit the site's official theme.
